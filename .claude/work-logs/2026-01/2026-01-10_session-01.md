# Work Session: Calling Timer Feature - Attempted & Reverted

**Date**: 2026-01-10
**Duration**: ~2 hours

## Summary
Attempted to debug and fix the calling phase auto-pass timer feature. After multiple fix attempts that didn't resolve the underlying Firebase state synchronization issue, the user decided to revert the entire timer feature from main.

## What Was Accomplished
- [x] Investigated auto-pass bug causing game hangs
- [x] Identified root cause: Firebase `update()` merges nested objects instead of replacing them
- [x] Attempted fix #1: Added `remove()` before `update()` to clear stale pendingCalls
- [x] Attempted fix #2: Changed from `null` to `'waiting'` string for unresponded seats
- [x] Updated type definitions, useGame hook, BotRunner, and submitCallResponse
- [x] Reverted all timer-related commits after fixes still had issues
- [x] Pushed clean revert to main

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Revert timer feature | Multiple fix attempts didn't resolve the core Firebase state sync issue; needed stable main branch |
| Use revert commits instead of reset | Preserves git history and allows normal push without force |

## Problems Encountered

1. **Problem**: Auto-pass would work once, then game would hang on subsequent calling phases
   **Root Cause**: Firebase's `update()` function merges nested objects. Old `pendingCalls` data (e.g., `seat0: 'pass'`) persisted from previous phases because Firebase doesn't store `null` values.
   **Attempted Solutions**:
   - `remove()` + `update()` - still had race condition
   - `'waiting'` string instead of `null` - type system updates made but didn't fully test

2. **Problem**: Client saw stale `myPendingCall` value even when Firebase data was correct
   **Analysis**: The BotRunner and game page appeared to see different pendingCalls data, suggesting a timing/sync issue between Firebase listeners

## Technical Notes

### Firebase Realtime Database Gotchas
- `update()` performs a merge on nested objects, not a replace
- `null` values are NOT stored - they delete the field
- Setting `{seat0: null, seat1: 'discarder', ...}` only stores the non-null values
- This causes stale data from previous writes to persist

### Potential Future Approaches
1. Use `set()` on specific paths instead of `update()` for atomic replacement
2. Use explicit sentinel values (like `'waiting'`) instead of relying on null
3. Add phase identifiers to pendingCalls to detect stale data
4. Consider using Firebase transactions for the entire calling phase state

## Files Changed (then reverted)
- `app/src/types/index.ts` - Added 'waiting' to PendingCall type
- `app/src/lib/game.ts` - Modified discardTile and submitCallResponse
- `app/src/hooks/useGame.ts` - Updated myPendingCall logic
- `app/src/hooks/useBotRunner.ts` - Updated waiting check logic
- `app/src/app/game/[code]/page.tsx` - Timer UI and auto-pass logic
- `app/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Timer setting UI
- `app/src/lib/rooms.ts` - Timer validation

## Commits

| SHA | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| faa2a77 | Revert calling phase timer feature (final state) |
| 515a52e | Fix calling phase race condition and add turn order UI (reverted) |
| dba19ef | Update documentation after calling timer feature (reverted) |
| 2d1fcc9 | Add calling phase timer with auto-pass (reverted) |
| 2f77beb | Add types for calling phase timer (WIP) (reverted) |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Revisit timer feature with better Firebase state management approach
- [ ] Consider using Firebase transactions for pendingCalls updates
- [ ] Test with explicit sentinel values instead of null
- [ ] May need to restructure pendingCalls to include phase identifier

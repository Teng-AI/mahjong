# Work Session: Bot Bug Fixes, Vercel Deployment, and Production Setup

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Project**: Fujian Mahjong Multiplayer Game
**Production URL**: https://mahjong-vibes.vercel.app/

## Overview

This session focused on fixing critical bot issues, deploying the game to production on Vercel, and setting up proper security and metadata for the live site.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Bot Stuck/Multiple Turn Bug Fix

**Problem**: Bots would either get stuck (not taking turns) or take multiple turns at once. The game would work after refreshing but not continue automatically.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Multiple useEffect executions passed lock checks before any could set the lock
2. Ref-based locks don't trigger re-renders when released - after bot action completes and lock is released in setTimeout, the effect doesn't re-run

**Solution**: Replaced complex ref-based locking with React's idiomatic effect cleanup pattern using a `cancelled` flag:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... early returns for invalid states ...

  let cancelled = false;

  const runBotActions = async () => {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    if (cancelled) return;

    // ... bot logic ...
  };

  runBotActions();

  return () => {
    cancelled = true;
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

**File Modified**: `app/src/hooks/useBotRunner.ts`

### 2. Bot Chow Logic Fix

**Problem**: Bots were never calling chow despite having valid chow options.

**Root Cause**: The `shouldCallChow` thresholds were too strict - only calling chow if shanten strictly improved, which rarely happens with chow.

**Solution**: Made thresholds more aggressive by difficulty level:

| Difficulty | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Easy | Call if shanten stays same, improves, or only gets 1 worse |
| Medium | Call if shanten stays same or improves |
| Hard | Same as medium, but slightly more conservative in late game (wall < 20) |

**Debug Logging Added**:
```
[Bot X] Next in turn check: seat=X, discarder=Y, nextSeat=Z, isNext=true/false
[Bot X] Chow options available: N
[Chow eval] shanten before=X, after=Y, difficulty=Z, wall=N
[Bot X] Should call chow: yes/no
```

**File Modified**: `app/src/hooks/useBotRunner.ts`

### 3. Bot Delay Adjustment

Changed bot action delay from variable timing to a fixed 1 second delay for better UX.

### 4. Documentation Cleanup

Updated `FUTURE_FEATURES.md` to reflect completed features:
- Winner screen redesign - COMPLETED
- Sound effects - COMPLETED
- Bot difficulty selection UI - COMPLETED
- Adjustable bot difficulty logic - COMPLETED

**Remaining Feature**: Kong (Quad) only

### 5. Firebase Security Rules

**Problem**: Firebase sent warning email about insecure database rules allowing any authenticated user to read/write the entire database.

**Solution**: Implemented proper security rules:
- Users can only read their own private hand (not opponents')
- Room code acts as access control (can't enumerate rooms)
- Basic auth required for all operations
- Players can only write to their own player slots

### 6. Vercel Deployment

**Deployed to production**: https://mahjong-vibes.vercel.app/

**Configuration**:
- Framework: Next.js
- Root Directory: `app`
- Environment Variables: All 7 Firebase config variables added
- Auto-deploy on push to `main` branch enabled

**Post-deployment**:
- Added Vercel domain to Firebase authorized domains

### 7. Metadata and Branding Updates

**Problem**: Page title showed "Create Next App" and link previews were generic.

**Solution**: Updated `app/src/app/layout.tsx` with comprehensive metadata:
- Title: "Mahjong Vibes"
- Description for SEO
- Keywords for search engines
- Author information
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter card metadata
- Apple Web App settings for iOS home screen
- metadataBase for proper URL resolution

**File Modified**: `app/src/app/layout.tsx`

## Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/src/hooks/useBotRunner.ts` | Effect cleanup pattern, chow thresholds, debug logging |
| `app/FUTURE_FEATURES.md` | Removed completed features, kept Kong only |
| `app/src/app/layout.tsx` | Title, description, Open Graph, Twitter cards, Apple Web App metadata |
| Firebase Console | Security rules for Realtime Database |
| Vercel | New deployment with environment variables |

## Key Technical Decisions

### Decision: Effect Cleanup vs Ref-Based Locking

**Context**: Needed to prevent multiple concurrent bot actions without causing stale state issues.

**Options**:
1. Ref-based locking with timestamps
2. React effect cleanup with cancelled flag
3. External state management (Redux/Zustand)

**Chosen**: Option 2 - Effect cleanup pattern

**Rationale**:
- React-idiomatic approach
- Automatically handles cleanup when dependencies change
- No re-render issues (refs don't trigger re-renders)
- Simpler code, easier to reason about

### Decision: Aggressive Chow Thresholds

**Context**: Bots never called chow because strict improvement is rare.

**Chosen**: Allow chow when shanten stays same or gets slightly worse (for easy bots)

**Rationale**:
- Chow is a valid strategic move even if it doesn't immediately improve hand
- Makes bots more realistic and varied
- Easy bots should be more aggressive (makes game easier for new players)

## Problems Solved

1. **Bot infinite loop** - Multiple effects running concurrently → Fixed with cleanup pattern
2. **Game stuck after human turn** - Lock held during human's turn → Fixed with early return before locking
3. **Lock release not triggering re-render** - Ref changes don't cause re-render → Fixed by removing refs entirely
4. **Bots not chowing** - Thresholds too strict → Made more aggressive

## Next Steps

- Monitor production site for any issues
- Consider adding a preview image for link sharing (og:image)
- Implement Kong (Quad) feature when ready - only remaining feature
